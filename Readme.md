# Aardvark.Rendering Project Scaffold
This project demonstrates how to use aardvark.rendering [1] in the F# interactive shell. 

The official samples can be found here: https://github.com/vrvis/aardvark.rendering/tree/master/src/Demo/Examples

# How to build:
build.cmd/build.sh, then run src/Tutorial.fsx in fsi.exe.

# Run from VisualStudio/MonoDevelop etc
src/Stub.sln contains an example setup for using Aardvark.Rendering. 
Interestingly, Tutorial.fs can be run from interactive shell AND is compiled by the provided project.
This is particularly useful when debugging your application.
